<p class="article__intro">Hello and welcome to my new blog series “Laravel How To”, where I will share all my Laravel experiences with you! How it comes that I use Laravel and what you should know about it, I will mention in this article.</p>
<h3 class="article__subheadline">Intro</h3>
<p>If you already know me from <a title="Twitter Christoph Rumpel" href="https://twitter.com/christophrumpel">Twitter</a>, then you probably have noticed that I am a big fan of the PHP framework Laravel by Tailor Otwell.<br />
A year ago I wanted to learn Ruby because I wasn’t satisfied with PHP anymore and I thought it was time to check out a new language. After two weeks of fun while diving into Ruby and Ruby on Rails I started a new job and I head to deal with PHP again =) Some friends told me to take a look at Laravel and that’s what I did. I immediately fall in love with this awesome framework and since that it is my PHP framework of choice.</p>
<h3 class="article__subheadline">Why Laravel</h3>
<blockquote><p>There are many ORM solutions out there, but none as Eloquent as… well Eloquent</p></blockquote>
<p class="quote-author"><a title="Dayle Rees" href="http://daylerees.com/">Dayle Rees</a></p>
<p>There are so many reasons that I could fill the whole article with information about that. Additionally I don’t want to write the same stuff here that you will find in so many other articles out there about Laravel. But just to be on the safe side, I will mention some main features.</p>
<p><span class="font-bold">Migration</span> - A great version control system for you database schema like you might know from Ruby on Rails. I just wouldn’t want to work without such a system anymore.</p>
<p><span class="font-bold">Composer</span> - Laravel is using composer,  a php dependency manager,  to install and update its dependencies. Besides it used to include third-party packages to your application. It has never been easier to manage your code.</p>
<p><span class="font-bold">Artisan</span> - Is the name of the Laravel command-line interface, which provides dozens of commands for your daily application work. This is one of my favourite features, because it makes working with Laravel super fast.</p>
<p><span class="font-bold">Eloquent</span> - This is the ORM solution which lets you interact with your database through PHP objects. This is damn powerful and easy to use.</p>
<p><span class="font-bold">Testing</span> - Laravel is built with testing in mind and  testing with PHPUnit is already included. How cool is that right?</p>
<p>And there is a lot more!</p>
